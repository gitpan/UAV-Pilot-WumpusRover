=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover - Control a rover over WiFi with a video feed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The WumpusRover was a project started specifically around C<UAV::Pilot>.  The 
library was always intended to be used on more than just the Parrot AR.Drone.  
With this addition, it is not only supporting a custom rover project, but also 
running much of the code on the rover itself.

The protocol is similar to ArduPilot protocol, taken from here:

L<http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/wiki/Protocol>

No tests were done against an existing ArduPilot implementation, so things may 
not be 100% compatible.  It should be close, however.  It is a goal to eventually
be compatible; this will happen Soon(tm).
